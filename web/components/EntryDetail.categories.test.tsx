/**
 * One render pin per entry category (W20).
 *
 * **Why this suite exists.** `EntryDetail.tsx` is 1,549 lines and branches
 * seven ways — grapes, regions, styles, flavours, continents, country gates,
 * and the STYLE-class special case — with separate header-tile code down each
 * branch. The e2e suite opened exactly one of them (a grape, reached by
 * clicking the first row of `/list/GRAPES`), so six branches of the app's
 * largest screen had never been rendered by anything. A `TypeError` on a
 * region's climate tile or a flavour's subclass chip would have shipped.
 *
 * **What is pinned, and why it is the section titles.** Not the copy, not the
 * layout, not the chip colours — the *ordered list of sections* each category
 * shows. That is the screen's structure rather than its styling, it is what a
 * reader of the page actually navigates by, and critically it is **the thing a
 * later decomposition of this file has to preserve**. `EntryDetail` is slated
 * to be split the way iOS split `EntryDetailScreen` into
 * `EntryDetailSections` and `EntryDetailRows`; a split that drops a section
 * from one category's branch is the obvious way for that work to go wrong,
 * and it is invisible to the type checker. These pins are what make that
 * refactor provable rather than hopeful.
 *
 * So the pins are deliberately **exact arrays, not `toContain`**. A section
 * that quietly disappears is exactly the failure mode; a containment check
 * would not see it.
 *
 * **The fixtures are real catalog entries**, not hand-built objects. A
 * synthetic entry proves the component renders something the test invented;
 * the point here is that it renders the data the app actually ships.
