        Vinodex runs entirely on your device. It has no user accounts and no login.
        Everything you do in the app — the wines you save, the notes you write, your
        study progress, and your settings — is stored locally on your device only. We
        do not operate servers that receive this information, and we cannot see it. We

        image from your photo library or use a built-in sample instead. Access to your
