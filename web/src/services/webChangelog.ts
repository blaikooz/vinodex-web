/**
 * The web app's own release history — an authored changelog the version is
 * tied to.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `APP_VERSION` was `0.1.0`, tagged 2026-07-29, and by the time anyone
 * checked, the tree was **102 commits past it**. Nothing was internally
 * inconsistent — `appVersion.test.ts` already holds the three spellings
 * (`APP_VERSION`, `package.json`, the display form) equal, and it did its job
 * perfectly. The gap was that nothing tied the number to *reality*: a version
 * can only go stale silently if bumping it costs nothing and not bumping it
 * costs nothing either.
 *
 * So the web borrows the discipline iOS already has. `shared/data/firmware.ts`
 * is where iOS's version lives, because a release there is an authored entry
 * somebody had to write; `AppVersion.swift` reads it rather than restating it.
 * `webChangelog.test.ts` enforces the same contract here: **the current
 * `APP_VERSION` must have an entry in this file.** The version cannot move
 * without someone saying what changed.
 *
 * ## This is NOT the device firmware, and must not become it
 *
 * `shared/data/firmware.ts` is the **device's** firmware line. It is shared
 * with iOS, it is what the BIOS POST and the FIRMWARE HISTORY panel print,
 * and its numbers are the phone's. This file is the **web shell's** own
 * release line. The two are deliberately separate and on different clocks — a
 * Vercel push is live in a minute, an App Store build waits on review — which
 * is the whole reason the web stopped mirroring iOS's version at the repo
 * split.
 *
 * `FirmwareHistoryScreen` draws the device line and says so. Nothing in this
 * file may be drawn there, and nothing there may be read from here.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * `CURRENT` plus `PREVIOUS`, newest first, ALL-CAPS headline, terse notes —
 * iOS's shape, so the two repos' release discipline reads the same to anyone
 * moving between them. Web's own three-part semver, because `package.json`,
 * the `v<version>` git tag and the nameplate have to be one spelling.
 *
 * ## Bumping
 *
 * One edit to `APP_VERSION`, one new entry here, one `v<version>` git tag.
 * The tag is the real record, exactly as it is on the iOS side.
