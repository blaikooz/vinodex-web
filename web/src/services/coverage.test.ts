 * These exist because a data swap that silently drops a UI state should fail
 * here — in two seconds — rather than on a deploy, or worse, not at all. The
 * numbers are pinned deliberately: a change you did not intend is exactly what
 * this is for. Update them on purpose when the data changes.
 *
 * One structural difference from Swift, and it is **pinned rather than
 * reconciled** (W18). `EntryCategory` on iOS cannot decode COUNTRY_GATE, so
 * that category is filtered out of the iOS bundle; the web ships those 80
 * gates as real entries. The two apps therefore honestly report two totals:
 *
 *     web BIOS / DATA panel   526   (446 + 80 country gates)
 *     iOS BIOS / DATA panel   446
 *
 * Both numbers are true about their own catalogue and neither is a bug. The
 * old header here said iOS totalled 284, which was three data batches out of
 * date while the assertion below already said 446 — a comment drifting from
 * the code it explains, in the file whose whole job is to stop that.
 *
 * The real guardrail is the equality: the five categories iOS counts sum to
 * exactly the number iOS reports, so the two apps are looking at one dataset.
 * Both sides of the divergence are asserted, so neither can move silently.
