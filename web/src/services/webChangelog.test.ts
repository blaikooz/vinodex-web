/**
 * The version cannot move without someone saying what changed.
 *
 * `APP_VERSION` sat at `0.1.0` while the tree ran 102 commits past its tag.
 * Nothing was inconsistent — `appVersion.test.ts` held all three spellings
 * equal and did its job — but nothing tied the number to reality, because
 * bumping it cost nothing and not bumping it cost nothing either.
 *
 * This suite is the cost. It is the web's version of the contract iOS gets
 * from `shared/data/firmware.ts`: the shipped version must be an authored
 * entry, and the entry has to be legible.
