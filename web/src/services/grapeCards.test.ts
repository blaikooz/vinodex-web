/**
 * The authored-bar merge in `shared/data/grapeCards.ts` (v7#C3).
 *
 * The 0.2.2 catalogue batch moved `colorIntensity` and `aromatics` from a
 * derivation over prose to values a human wrote down, and left the other three
 * bars deriving as before. That makes the join between the two a *merge*, and
 * the merge has one way to go wrong that no data currently exposes:
 *
 *     colorIntensity: authored.colorIntensity ?? (type === 'red' ? 4 : 2)
 *
 * With `||` instead of `??`, an authored **0** — a legal value on every one of
 * these bars — would be discarded and silently replaced by the derivation. No
 * grape authors 0 today, so the bug would ship green and surface the first
 * time somebody wrote one down. It is precisely the kind of thing a later
 * "simplification" undoes, which is why it is pinned rather than trusted.
 *
 * Two assertions, because neither is sufficient alone. The behavioural one
 * proves the authored values genuinely win over the derivation *today*; the
 * source one proves they would still win at 0, which no dataset can currently
 * demonstrate. `shared/` is a mirror and is read here, never written.
