// The static share layer: per-page Open Graph cards, sitemap.xml, robots.txt.
//
// The web app is a Vite SPA, so a crawler fetching a shared link only sees
// the static index.html and never runs the router — every shared card would
// unfurl with the generic studio title. This writes a static
// dist/<route>/index.html for every page worth sharing: a copy of the built
// shell with that page's own title, description, OG/Twitter tags and canonical
// link written into its <head>. Vercel serves the matching static file before
// the SPA rewrite, so crawlers get the page's card and real visitors still
// boot into the app (same hashed bundle) at the right route.
//
// Two kinds of page, one mechanism:
//   - the shareable catalogue entries at /detail/<id> (since v0.6.1), and the
//     same pages mirrored at /entry/<id> (since v0.6.62) because that is the
//     URL the iOS share sheet mints — entry ids match the iOS app's, so a card
//     shared from iOS resolves here;
//   - the site's own pages at /apps, /who-we-are, /contact, /privacy (since
//     v0.6.15), plus the landing's tags rewritten into the shell itself.
//
// Everything this writes is decided by `web/src/services/siteIndex.ts`, which
// `siteIndex.test.ts` holds against the route table — this file only formats
// and writes. The sitemap and robots come from the same module for the same
// reason: three outputs that must not drift from one route table.
//
// Run after `vite build` (npm postbuild).
