    // **The check the ask asked for, done first: red carries no other meaning on
    // the globe.** A continent's `color` is one value serving two things — the
    // marker plate on `RetroGlobeScreen` and the icon well behind the drawn globe
    // in `EntryVisual.continentVisual` — and nothing else on that screen reads
    // it. Selection is drawn as scale and stroke weight, locking is
    // `AccessStore`, and the six continents are simply six colours. So this is
    // one row in a table, exactly as the ask suspected.
    //
    // It also closes the complaint 0.7.1's A3 left open. That pass moved South
    // America off #73343A because it "sat one to five points per channel from
    // North America's #722F37", and signed off with "no two continents sit closer
    // than North America and Europe already did" — which named this pair as the
    // remaining offence and left it standing. Claret against dark claret at
    // marker size was two thirds of the Old World reading as one blob. Cobalt is
    // the furthest thing on the wheel from the five colours already in the set,
    // and it is the colour Europe wears in the one other place anybody has drawn
    // these six together: the Olympic rings, which is also what `vinodex-web`'s
    // `OLYMPIC_CONTINENT_COLORS` already uses for `CONT_EUROPE`.
