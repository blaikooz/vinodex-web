 * Descriptive level -> a 0-5 stat bar (0.7.4, sommbot's audit).

 * **Tests run longest-match-first, and that is load-bearing**, because every
 * test is a substring test: `'Medium-High'.includes('high')` is true, so a bare
 * `high` placed above `medium-high` swallows it. Two things were wrong here.
 *
 * The consequential one: **`"None"` matched nothing and fell through to the
 * default of 3**, so all 60 white grapes carrying `tannin: "None"` drew a
 * half-full tannin bar -- the one value the bar exists to distinguish, rendered
 * as the middle of the scale. It is now 0, an empty bar, which is the truth.
 *
 * The lesser one: `medium-high` sat below `high` and was dead code, and
 * `Medium-Low`/`Low-Medium` fell into `medium`. Both are corrected here for the
 * function's sake; neither moves a rendered value, because the two call sites
 * round and `Math.round(3.5) === 4` and `Math.round(2.5) === 3` are what those
 * inputs already produced. Only the `none` line changes what anybody sees.
 *
 * `bodyFromText` below had the same defect shape and was deliberately left
 * alone in that batch. It is fixed in 0.7.5 (E) -- see its own note.

 * test, so `'Medium-Full'.includes('full')` was true and the `medium-full`
 * line below it had never once executed: **the 16 grapes authored
 * `body: "Medium-Full"` drew a 5/5 bar**, identical to the 34 authored
 * `"Full"`. Chardonnay and Merlot read as full-bodied as Cabernet Sauvignon
 * and Syrah, which is the one distinction a body bar exists to draw. They are
 * 4/5 now.
 *
 * `light-medium` was dead in the same way -- `'Light-Medium'.includes('medium')`
 * -- and is corrected here for the function's sake rather than for anything
 * visible: the 22 grapes carrying it round to 3 either way, because the call
 * site rounds and `Math.round(2.5) === 3` is what `medium` already returned.
 *
 * So one input moves and one does not, and both branches are now reachable,
