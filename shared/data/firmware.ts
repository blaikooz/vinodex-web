/**
 * The device's firmware history (iOS 0.7.3, F3).
 *
 * **This file is the version number.** Until 0.7.3 the authored version lived in
 * `AppVersion.fallback`, a Swift literal, and the changelog lived nowhere at all
 * -- it was forty lines of doc comment above that literal. F3 asks for one data
 * source that both the boot POST (A1) and the FIRMWARE HISTORY panel (A3) read,
 * and `shared/` is where this project's data lives, so it is here.
 *
 * `AppVersion` did not go away and did not become a second source of truth: it
 * still owns the *resolution* rule (a version the bundle genuinely declares beats
 * the authored one, and xtool's stamped `1.0.0` placeholder beats neither), and
 * its `fallback` now reads `FIRMWARE_VERSION` through the generated
 * `firmware.json` instead of restating it.
 *
 * **Bumping a version is editing `CURRENT` below**, moving the release it
 * displaces to the head of `PREVIOUS`, and running `npm run generate`.
 *
 * The long "why does this build carry this number" notes stay in
 * `AppVersion.swift`. They are the engineering record and answer a question no
 * player asks; what is here is what the device is willing to say about itself.
 *
 * **Newest first**, which is both the order the panel prints and the reason
 * `FIRMWARE_VERSION` can be derived rather than declared. The generator asserts
 * the ordering, the three-component shape, the ASCII/length rules and that no
 * version appears twice.
 *
 * ## One sentence a note, one line a change (0.8.91, H1)
 *
 * The whole file was rewritten to that rule in 0.8.91. The notes had grown from
 * 83 characters at 0.6.6 to 2,398 at 0.8.9, where a single line ran 340 -- three
 * sentences explaining a feature, its reasoning and its edge cases, in a panel
 * whose readers are trying to find out what changed. The 28 entries carried
 * 26,931 characters of notes and now carry 15,791, and the longest single note
 * is 139 characters where it was 340.
 *
 * **What was cut is the second and third sentence of each note, not the notes.**
 * Every change that was listed is still listed; what went is the argument for
 * it, which is what the doc comments in the source are for. `H1` also asks for
 * the same treatment on the titles, and the ones that went were the editorial
 * ones -- A DIAL, NOT A LIST and PROSECCO IS NOT A ROSE are good sentences and
 * bad headings, because a heading in a list of twenty-nine has to say which
 * release you are looking at.
 *
 * The gate is unchanged and is what bounds the rewrite: headlines are uppercase
 * ASCII and at most 24 characters, and every release keeps at least one note.
 * Nothing caps a note's length, so the rule below is a discipline rather than a
 * check -- if it slips again, that is the thing to add.
 */

/**
 * The build this source tree produces.
 *
 * Named rather than written as the first element of the array below, so
 * `FIRMWARE_VERSION` can be derived without indexing — `vinodex-web` compiles
 * `shared/` under `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, where `FIRMWARE_RELEASES[0]` is
 * `FirmwareRelease | undefined` and the whole "one source of truth" arrangement
 * would have hung off a non-null assertion. This also gives the thing you edit
 * each batch a name, which is the file's entire job.
